Description:
There is a church whose members attend small group Bible studies every week. one of their goals is for all the church members to get to know each other by going to a small group with every other member. Also, they want everyone to have a chance to visit everyone else's home. They would like married couples to always go together to the same group.
Your goal is to design and develop a program that will create a list of groups for each week in a way that meets the church's goals.

-Users should pick the small group size
-If the community is not an even multiple of the group size, you may assign one more member to as many greoups as needed.

Program Output:
-List of lists
  -i.e. a list of groups for each week
-Each iteration produces a list of groups for one week in the most evenly distributed way possible.
-Each list has a host
-Married couples must remain together.
-Everyone needs to visit every home
